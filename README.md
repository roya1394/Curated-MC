# Description

This script takes in several user inputs to create a custom playlist based off of these inputs. The list of inputs for this script are mood, genre, and artist. 
Before running the script, the user needs to replace the USER_ID and USER_SECRET with their own on lines 8 and 9 respectively, which can be obatined by going 
to the spotify for developers website. Additionally the script asks the user to define the length of the playlist they want created and, if they want, a name 
for the playlist. If no name is given the script will assign a default name to the playlist. Once these inputs are assigned, the script will create the playlist 
and provide a link to the newly created playlist. The playlist will also be available in Spotify for the user whose details are provided.
